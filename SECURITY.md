# Security and Bug Bounty Program

While audits of the protocol can be found [here](https://github.com/pickle-finance/protocol/tree/master/audits), a bug bounty program is necessary to further ensure the safety of the protocol. This document describes the bug bounty in detail and other security considerations.

Pickle Finance's Bug Bounty Program was born from [discussions](https://forum.pickle.finance/t/rfc-bug-bounty-program/545) on the forum. The program is heavily inspired by Yearn's own [program](https://github.com/iearn-finance/yearn-protocol/blob/develop/SECURITY.md).
